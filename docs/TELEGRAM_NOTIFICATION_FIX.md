# Telegram Notification System Fix

## Issue Identified

We identified an issue with the tech spec notifications in the Rozoom-KI application deployed on Render.com:

1. **Contact Form Notifications** - These are working correctly because they send directly via `send_contact_form_notification()`.

2. **Tech Spec Notifications** - These were not being delivered because:
   - The code was generating messages with `send_tech_spec_notification(..., return_message_only=True)` 
   - Then adding them to a queue with `queue_telegram_message(message_content)`
   - But the messages were "stuck" in the queue at `data/telegram_queue` because:
     - No worker service was configured in render.yaml to process the queue
     - The script `scripts/process_telegram_queue.py` was not being executed

## Solution Implemented

We've implemented a simple and reliable fix by sending tech spec notifications directly, bypassing the queue system:

```python
# OLD CODE:
message_content = send_tech_spec_notification(tech_spec_data, contact_info, return_message_only=True)
queue_telegram_message(message_content)
current_app.logger.info(f"Technical specification notification queued for {user_email}")

# NEW CODE:
send_tech_spec_notification(tech_spec_data, contact_info)
current_app.logger.info(f"Technical specification notification SENT for {user_email}")
```

This solution:
1. Eliminates the need for a separate worker to process the queue
2. Uses the same reliable direct-sending method that already works for contact form notifications
3. Maintains all the existing retry logic in the `send_telegram_message()` function
4. Requires minimal changes (just 2 lines of code)

## Testing

You can test Telegram notifications using the included script:

```bash
# Set your credentials (if not already in environment)
$env:TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="YOUR_TOKEN"
$env:TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID="YOUR_CHAT_ID"

# Run the test script
python .\scripts\test_telegram.py
```

## Backup

A backup of the original file was created at:
```
app\agents\controller.py.bak
```

## Additional Note

If you prefer the queue-based system in the future, you would need to add a worker service in the `render.yaml` file to run the `scripts/process_telegram_queue.py` script periodically, but for most use cases the direct sending approach is simpler and more reliable.
